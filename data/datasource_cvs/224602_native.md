## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- Empty files: 11 files (4.5% of total); all confined to initial backfill on 2025-02-20/21, none afterwards.
- File count consistency: Predominantly one file per day (mode=1 across all days).
- Lag pattern (filename-date → upload-date):
  • Initial backfill: Extended lags of 30-50 days for January files.
  • Normal operation: Median 1 day, mean 1.1 days, standard deviation ±0.3 days.
- Upload timing consistency: Typical window 14:30-16:30 UTC; some variation by day of week.
- Day-of-week pattern: All days show active processing; weekends consistently show higher volumes.
- Processing issues: 3 deleted files (1.2% of total); always followed by re-upload of same date within 1-3 days.
- Upload gaps: Only 5 isolated days without uploads across 194-day window (≈2.5% of days).

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2025-02-20 to 2025-09-01, 246 files with 94.3% processing success rate.
- Upload pattern: Essentially daily cadence including weekends; 97.5% of days have uploads.
- Timing precision: Typical upload window 14:30-16:30 UTC; weekend uploads follow same pattern.
- Volume distribution: Sunday shows highest per-file volume (599k rows median); Monday highest total (26.3M rows).
- File size characteristics: Normal range 104,642-739,491 rows (95% interval); median 473,194.5 rows per file.
- Day-of-week consistency: Weekends show higher volumes than weekdays (Sat: 575k, Sun: 599k median rows).
- Data drift: After March 2025, median file size increased from <400k to >500k rows and stabilized.
- Processing anomalies: Empty/small files (4.5%) confined to initial backfill period (Feb 20-21); not part of ongoing pattern.
