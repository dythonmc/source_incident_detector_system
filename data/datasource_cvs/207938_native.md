## **2. Upload Schedule and File Processing Patterns**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of file upload patterns, including timing consistency, volume trends, and operational windows. Understanding these patterns helps predict resource needs and identify potential anomalies.

- **File Processing Statistics by Day**: The following table presents key metrics about file processing, including volume consistency (mean, median, mode) and variability (standard deviation):

- **File Format Analysis**:
  • Exclusive format: `.csv` (100% of files)
  • No alternative formats or compression methods observed
- **Processing Status Summary**:
  • Successfully processed: 63.35% (177 files)
  • Empty files: 31.67% (89 files)
  • Failed processing: 1.07% (3 files)
  • Deleted files: 0.71% (2 files)
  • Stopped processing: 0.36% (1 file)
  • This processing pattern suggests stable data transmission with expected empty files.

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- Empty files: 319 files (31.9% of total); 98% associated with POS_MARKETPLACE channel.
- Empty file distribution: Varies by day of week (Mon: 18%, Tue: 15%, Wed: 8%, Thu: 21%, Fri: 9%, Sat: 31%).
- Multi-part uploads: 37 distinct dates show part numbering; typical pattern is 3 parts (0000-0002).
- Upload timing consistency:
  • Standard pattern: 10:45-12:30 UTC window (mean 11:17 UTC).
  • Occasional evening uploads (20:50-21:40 UTC) represent <1% of files.
- Lag pattern (filename date → upload date):
  • Normal flow: 1-2 days (median ≈1.1 days, standard deviation ≈0.4 days).
  • Bulk backfills: Extended lags up to 95 days observed for historical data.
- Statement type distribution: POS_MARKETPLACE (35%), SHOP_MARKETPLACE (34%), PAGO (31%).
- Bulk upload events: Two major episodes (2025-01-03: 120+ files; 2025-08-20: triplicate copies).

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2024-10-01 to 2025-09-01, approximately 1,000 files (67.8% processed successfully).
- File distribution: Consistent 3 files per day pattern (mode=3 across all days); Sunday shows no activity.
- Volume characteristics: Highly skewed distribution (mean: 4,156 vs median: 119 rows).
- Day-of-week pattern: Thursday shows exceptional peak volume (35.3M rows); Monday second highest (9.6M rows).
- Empty file pattern: 31.9% of files contain 0 rows; concentrated in POS_MARKETPLACE channel (98% of empty files).
- Channel behavior: POS files show binary pattern - either empty (predominant since Feb-2025) or very large.
- File size distribution: 48.8% of files contain <100 rows; normal range 0-37,376 rows (95% interval).
- Upload reliability: Extremely consistent timing (10:45-12:30 UTC); gaps >24h are rare (3 instances, all during holidays).
