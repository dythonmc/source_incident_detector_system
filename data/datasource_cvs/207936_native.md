## **2. Upload Schedule and File Processing Patterns**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of file upload patterns, including timing consistency, volume trends, and operational windows. Understanding these patterns helps predict resource needs and identify potential anomalies.

- **File Processing Statistics by Day**: The following table presents key metrics about file processing, including volume consistency (mean, median, mode) and variability (standard deviation):

• Weekends always have SHOP & PAGO small files; POS files are structurally empty (rows = 0).  
• No uploads outside schedule window except rare backfills.

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- Empty files: 319 files (31.9% of total); predominantly associated with __POS channel.
- Empty file distribution: Weekdays show 30-40% empty rate; weekends slightly higher at 38%.
- Multi-part uploads: 9% of days show multi-part structure; typical pattern is 3 parts (0000-0002).
- Upload timing: Extremely consistent 11:01-11:44 UTC window (median 11:06 UTC) across all days.
- Lag pattern (filename date → upload date):
  • Weekdays: median 1 day, standard deviation ≈0.3 day.
  • Weekend files typically uploaded Monday (lag = 1-2 days).
- Channel distribution: Remarkably even split between _SHOP (34%), __PAGO (33%), __POS (33%).
- Bulk backfill events: Two significant occurrences (2025-01-03 with 54 files; 2025-08-20 with 9 files).

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2024-11-07 to 2025-09-01, exactly 1,000 files (67.8% processed successfully).
- File distribution: Consistent 3 files per day pattern (mode=3) across all days of week.
- Volume characteristics: Highly skewed distribution (mean: 4,144 vs median: 105 rows).
- Empty file pattern: 31.9% of files contain 0 rows; predominantly __POS channel files.
- Day-of-week pattern: Friday shows exceptional peak volume (2.5M rows); Tuesday second highest (520K rows).
- Small file prevalence: 49.5% of files contain <100 rows; normal range 0-37,346 rows (95% interval).
- Channel behavior: __POS consistently shows highest empty file rate; __PAGO shows gradual volume increase (+45% over 10 months).
- Upload reliability: Extremely consistent timing (11:01-11:44 UTC); absence of weekday uploads would be anomalous.
