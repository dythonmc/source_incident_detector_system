- **File Format Analysis**:
  • Exclusive format: `.csv` (100% of files)
  • No alternative formats or compression methods observed
- **Processing Status Summary**:
  • Successfully processed: 69.77% (60 files)
  • Empty files: 30.23% (26 files)
  • This consistent processing rate suggests stable data transmission with expected empty files.

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- Empty files: 106 / 877 (12.09%); occur across all days of week with highest concentration on Monday and Tuesday.
- Multi-part uploads: 56% of files are multi-part (2-19 parts); Wednesday shows highest multi-part activity (mean 7.92 files).
- Lag (filename date → upload timestamp):  
  Median = +1 day; Mean = +1.3 days; St.dev ≈ 0.6 day.  
  95 % within +1 → +3 days.
- Upload time consistency: 95% of uploads occur between 07:30-15:30 UTC across all days of week.
- Volume pattern: Wednesday shows highest volume (38.4M rows) with largest file sets (up to 48 files in a day).
- Row capping: Non-empty files consistently show maximum of 150,000 rows, suggesting systematic row limiting.

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2024-10-01 to 2025-09-01, 1 000 files (877 with row data).
- Normal processing pattern: Daily uploads with 7-day coverage; Wednesday peak volume (38.4M rows, mean 124,260 rows/file).
- File volume consistency: Non-empty files consistently capped at exactly 150,000 rows (strong median value across Wed-Sun).
- Monday/Tuesday pattern: High empty file rate (>80%), significantly lower volume than other days.
- Weekend processing: Active and substantial (Sat: 12.3M rows, Sun: 10.5M rows); absence would be anomalous.
- Multi-part behavior: Largest sets observed on Wednesdays (up to 48 files, 19-part maximum observed on 2025-04-23).
- Row distribution highly consistent for non-empty files (median 150,000 rows Wed-Sun); suggests systematic row limiting per file.
