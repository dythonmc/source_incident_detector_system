    ### Datasource CV: 'Soop Transaction PIX 3'

_(Based on 173 most-recent files from 2025-06-24 → 2025-09-16)_

## **1. Filename Patterns**

- Canonical prefix: `2__Soop_CPIX_YYYYMMDD_M_  _<CHANNEL>_<hash>_14380200000121_<part>.csv`
  • CHANNEL values observed: `PIX` (≈77 %) and `BANKING` (≈23 %).  
  • `<part>` 4-digit, zero-padded; single-part files are always `0000`.
- Legacy prefix without double underscore (`2_Soop_…`) appears in ≈30 % (still accepted).
- Multi-part days (same date, part 0001/0002/0003 …) occur for large PIX files – 10 distinct calendar dates, 24 files total.


## **2. Upload Schedule and File Processing Patterns**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of file upload patterns, including timing consistency, volume trends, and operational windows. Understanding these patterns helps predict resource needs and identify potential anomalies.

- **File Processing Statistics by Day**: The following table presents key metrics about file processing, including volume consistency (mean, median, mode) and variability (standard deviation):

- **File Format Analysis**:
  • Exclusive format: `.csv` (100% of files)
  • No alternative formats or compression methods observed
- **Processing Status Summary**:
  • Successfully processed: 98.84% (171 files)
  • Stopped processing: 1.16% (2 files)
  • This high success rate indicates robust data transmission with minimal interruptions.

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- Empty files: 27 files (5.4% of total); distribution across days shows minimal pattern (0.02-0.11 mean per day).
- Multi-part uploads: 10 calendar dates with multi-part files (2-3 parts typical); all containing >500k rows each.
- Lag between filename date and upload date:  
  • Regular pattern: 1-2 days (median = 1 day).
  • Initial bulk load (2024-11-20): 17-49 days lag (historical catch-up phase).
- Upload timing consistency: 95% of uploads occur within tight 11:01-11:33 UTC window across all days.
- Channel distribution: PIX (≈77%) and BANKING (≈23%) show consistent pattern throughout dataset.
- Processing issues: 3 stopped files (0.6%) and 1 deleted file (0.2%), all concentrated on 2025-08-20.

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2024-11-20 to 2025-09-01, 500 files (93.8% processed successfully).
- Upload pattern: Consistent daily uploads across all days of week; mode=2 files per day (PIX+BANKING).
- Timing precision: Remarkably consistent upload window (11:01-11:33 UTC); 95% of files within this range.
- Volume distribution: Wednesday (17.3M rows) and Friday (17.2M rows) show highest total volume.
- File size characteristics: Normal range 0-506,743 rows (95% interval); median 83,190 rows per file.
- Processing reliability: High success rate (93.8%); minimal failures (0.8% combined stopped/deleted).
- Data-gap period: Jan-Mar 2025 shows anomalous pattern with empty/near-empty files; considered outlier phase.
- Weekend activity: Strong weekend processing (Sat: 12.1M rows, Sun: 9.5M rows); absence would be anomalous.
