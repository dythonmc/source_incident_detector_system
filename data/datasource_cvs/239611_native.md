_(Based on 121 most-recent files from 2025-06-24 → 2025-09-16)_

## **1. Filename Patterns**

- Canonical form  
  `sale-adjustments-{cnpj}-{merchant}-{yyyymmddhhmmss}-{yyyymmddhhmmss}.csv`
  • prefix constant  
  • CNPJ always `14380200000121`  
  • merchant appears as **_** (≈71 %) or **anota-ai** (≈29 %).
- Date‐stamps inside the name are the covered data window (start → end); they are not the upload date.
- No part-Wumbering suffix found; duplicates appear when a retry creates a second file with identical name and later “stopped” status.
- Entities (counted on first appearance in the last ~1 000 uploads)  
  – merchant “_”: ~189 files  
  – merchant “anota-ai”: ~76 files

## **2. Upload Schedule and File Processing Patterns**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of file upload patterns, including timing consistency, volume trends, and operational windows. Understanding these patterns helps predict resource needs and identify potential anomalies.

- **File Processing Statistics by Day**: The following table presents key metrics about file processing, including volume consistency (mean, median, mode) and variability (standard deviation):

| Day | Mean Files | Median Files | Mode Files | StdDev Files | Min Files | Max Files |

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- Empty files: 10 files (4.5% of total); concentrated in anota-ai merchant files.
- Processing issues: 6 files (2.7%) with stopped status; typically following a processed file with identical name.
- Merchant distribution patterns:
  • _ (71% of files): Consistent delivery of larger files (11k-35k rows).
  • anota-ai (29% of files): Predominantly small or empty files.
- Multi-day bundles: Regular pattern of _ 3-day consolidations (~43k rows) every Monday after 2025-06-30.
- Lag pattern (filename date range end → upload date): Median 1 day, mean ~1.2 days, standard deviation ±0.6 days.
- Upload timing consistency: Extremely tight window (20:12-20:23 UTC) for most days; bulk backfills at 18:38 UTC.
- Day-of-week pattern: Business days primarily; Wednesday shows highest file count (mean 6.54 files).

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2025-04-23 to 2025-09-01, 222 files with 92.8% processing success rate.
- Upload pattern: Consistent business day activity; minimal weekend presence (only occasional Saturdays, no Sundays).
- Timing precision: Remarkably consistent upload window (20:12-20:23 UTC); bulk backfills at different times.
- Volume distribution: Wednesday (1.19M rows) and Thursday (1.06M rows) show highest total volumes.
- File size characteristics: Normal range 0-36,874 rows (95% interval); median 13,818.5 rows per file.
- Merchant-specific patterns:
  • _: Defines volume expectations (11k-35k rows); high processing success.
  • anota-ai: Consistently small (<50 rows) or empty files; higher failure rate.
- Data drift: Temporary size increase in May 2025 (~30k rows) that reverted by July 2025.
- Processing anomalies: Monday consolidated files (≥40k rows) appear weekly since June 30, 2025; considered normal up to ~55k rows.
